# TRD_GWAS
GWAS of ECT-based predicted TRD

This is a repository of all scripts used for genetic analyses of our [publication](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.10.22278630v1.full-text), which include:
* meta-analysis using METAL and PLINK
* GWAS results plotting: QQ, Manhattan, Forest plots
* LDSC SNP heritability estimation and genetic correlation
* Polygenic risk score (PRS) association with leave-one-out summary statistics

Prerequisite software: METAL and plink for meta-analysis, PRSCS for polygenic risk scores

Check out the Wiki for detailed steps.
Cohort specific summary statistics from samples in VUMC, MGB, Geisinger, and MVP are available [here]() for download.
